A Python-based CLI project that provides real-time autocomplete suggestions and autocorrect capabilities using:
- ✅ Trie Data Structure
- ✅ DFS + Heap for Top-K autocomplete
- ✅ Damerau-Levenshtein Distance for typo correction

- Returns top-5 suggestions sorted by popularity

### 🔁 Autocorrect:
- Uses Damerau-Levenshtein to catch common typing errors
- Suggests close matches within edit distance of 2
